  # You can configure a custom block (or use a class respond to `#call`) that must
  # return `true` in case Application instance supports requested OAuth grant flow
  # during the authorization request to the server. This configuration +doesn't+
  # set flows per application, it only allows to check if application supports
  # specific grant flow.
  #
  # For example you can add an additional database column to `oauth_applications` table,
  # say `t.array :grant_flows, default: []`, and store allowed grant flows that can
  # be used with this application there. Then when authorization requested Doorkeeper
  # will call this block to check if specific Application (passed with client_id and/or
  # client_secret) is allowed to perform the request for the specific grant type
  # (authorization, password, client_credentials, etc).
  #
  # Example of the block:
  #
  #   ->(flow, client) { client.grant_flows.include?(flow) }
  #
  # In case this option invocation result is `false`, Doorkeeper server returns
  # :unauthorized_client error and stops the request.

  #
  # When you call option, it defines two methods. One method will take place
  # in the +Config+ class and the other method will take place in the
  # +Builder+ class.
  #
  # The +name+ parameter will set both builder method and config attribute.
  # If the +:as+ option is defined, the builder method will be the specified
  # option while the config attribute will be the +name+ parameter.
  #
  # If you want to introduce another level of config DSL you can
  # define +builder_class+ parameter.
  # Builder should take a block as the initializer parameter and respond to function +build+
  # that returns the value of the config attribute.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # * [:+as+] Set the builder method that goes inside +configure+ block
  # * [+:default+] The default value in case no option was set
  # * [+:builder_class+] Configuration option builder class
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #    option :name

  # Boolean indicator of whether or not the presented token
  # is currently active.  The specifics of a token's "active" state
  # will vary depending on the implementation of the authorization
  # server and the information it keeps about its tokens, but a "true"
  # value return for the "active" property will generally indicate
  # that a given token has been issued by this authorization server,
  # has not been revoked by the resource owner, and is within its
  # given time window of validity (e.g., after its issuance time and
  # before its expiration time).
  #
  # Any other error is considered an "inactive" token.
  #
  # * The token requested does not exist or is invalid
  # * The token expired
  # * The token was issued to a different client than is making this request
  #
  # Since resource servers using token introspection rely on the
  # authorization server to determine the state of a token, the
  # authorization server MUST perform all applicable checks against a
  # token's state. For instance, these tests include the following:
  #
  #    o  If the token can expire, the authorization server MUST determine
  #       whether or not the token has expired.
  #    o  If the token can be issued before it is able to be used, the
  #       authorization server MUST determine whether or not a token's valid
  #       period has started yet.
  #    o  If the token can be revoked after it was issued, the authorization
  #       server MUST determine whether or not such a revocation has taken
  #       place.
  #    o  If the token has been signed, the authorization server MUST
  #       validate the signature.
  #    o  If the token can be used only at certain resource servers, the
  #       authorization server MUST determine whether or not the token can
  #       be used at the resource server making the introspection call.

  #
  # Endpoint must first validate the authentication.
  # If the authentication is invalid, the endpoint should respond with

  # To prevent token scanning attacks, the endpoint MUST also require
